         Guidelines for QUIC Multipath over Path Aware Networks
               draft-zaeschke-scion-quic-multipath-latest

Abstract

   This document provides guidelines for using the Multipath Extension
   for QUIC [QUIC-MP] with path aware networks (PAN).  PANs may provide
   hundreds of paths between endpoint, including detailed path metadata
   that facilitates an informed selection.  This offers opportunities
   for new or improved algorithms for multipath networking.

   This document discusses mostly algorithms for path selection.
   However, it also comments on congestion control and load distribution
   (scheduling), as well as general considerations for API design and
   applications that use multipath QUIC over SCION.

   *TODO*

   *  Section on QUIC-specific advantages?

1.  Introduction

   Path aware networks (PAN) can provide many detailed metadata about
   available paths, such as latency, bandwidth, MTU, geographic
   location, or many other properties.

   Even when just one path is used, this allows selecting the best path
   for each use case while providing a suitable backup paths if the
   first paths fails or becomes unatractive.

   In the case of concurrent multipathing, detailed metadata provides
   information about any links where different paths overlap and about
   the properties of these links.  This allows, for example, choosing
   paths such that they don't share low bandwidth links.

   This is useful for developing or improving network related
   algorithms, for example for path selection, or more informed
   algorithms for congestion control.

   This document first identifies and categorizes multipath usage
   scenarios (Section 4), then discusses guidelines for path selection
   algorithms and suggests how these may be applicable to congestion
   control algorithms, without discussing the later in detail
   (Section 5).  Finally, in order to facilitate these algorithms, this
   documents contains suggestions for API design and general use in
   applications (Section 7).

   As a practical example of a PAN and how path metadata can be made
   available and path selection and routing can be implemented, we refer
   to the SCION [SCION-CP], [SCION-DP].

1.1.  SCION

   One example of a PAN is SCION [SCION-CP], [SCION-DP].  SCION is an
   interdomain routing protocol that provides path metada on the level
   of individual router interfaces.  This provide many opportunities for
   improving congestion control and other algorithms.  They also avoid
   some problems that gave rise to current algorithms.

   The SCION protocol makes detailed path information available to
   endpoints.  Besides the 4-tuple of address/IP at each endpoint, the
   information includes a list of all traversed ASes and respective
   links between ASes, as well as metadata about ASes and links,
   including MTU, bandwidth, latency, AS internal hopcount, or
   geolocation information.

1.2.  Terminology

   *Autonomous System (AS)*: An autonomous system is a network under a
   common administrative control.  For example, the network of an
   Internet service provider or organization can constitute an AS.

   *Endpoint*: An endpoint is the start or the end of a path, as defined
   in [PATH-VOCABULARY].

   *Inter AS link*: A direct link between two external interfaces of two
   ASes.

   *Intra AS link*: A direct link between twi internal interfaces of a
   single AS.  A direct link may contains several internal hops.

   *Link*: General term that refers to "inter-AS links" and "intra-AS
   links".

   *Path*: Consists of a 4-tuple of address/IP at each endpoint, a list
   of all traversed ASes, and links inside and between ASes, including
   interface IDs on border routers of each AS.

   *Path metadata*: Path metadata is additional data that is available
   to clients when they request a selection of paths to a destination.
   Path metadata is authenticated wrt to owner of each link, but
   otherwise not verified.  Path metadata includes data about ASes and
   links, such as MTU, bandwidth, latency, AS internal hopcount, or
   geolocation information.  Path metadata is stable, e.i. it is updated
   infrequently, probably at most once per hour.  Properties such as
   bandwidth and latency therefore represent hardware properties rather
   than live traffic information.

   *SCMP*: A signaling protocol analogous to the Internet Control
   Message Protocol (ICMP).  This is described in [SCION-CP].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Multipath Features

   This document discusses multipath features that are available in
   SCION [SCION-CP], [SCION-DP].  However, the discussion is kept
   general and relevant to all PAN that support these features.

3.1.  Features

3.1.1.  Path Metadata Granularity

   We assume a protocol for inter-AS routing that provides path
   information per AS, more specifically per border router of an AS and
   per any link between any border routers (link may be internal or
   external to an AS).

3.1.2.  Path Metadata Dimensions

   We assume a protocol a provides information on links and border
   routers, such as MTU, bandwidth, latency, geo-location, as well as
   identities (interface ID, port and IP) of border routers.  We assume
   the data is static, wich means that bandwidth and latency reflect
   performance at minimum load rather than current or recent load.

3.1.3.  Path Metadata Liveliness

   We assume that path metadata is updated at most every few hours.
   This should be more than sufficient since all values reflect hardware
   properties rather than current traffic load.

3.1.4.  Path Metadata Reliability

   We assume that all values are correct.  The metadata is
   cryptographically protected.  It is signe by the data originator,
   which is the relevant AS owner.  However, the data correctness is not
   verified, instead we rely on the AS onwer to be honest.

3.1.5.  Multi-Inteface

   *TODO remove this?* This document discusses multipathing mainly in
   the sense of multiple paths per 4-tuple.  Multipathing over multiple
   interfaces is not discussed in detail.

4.  Multipath Categorization

   This document distinguishes the following usage categories:

   *  High bandwidth (BW): Optimizing bandwidth by parallel transfer on
      multiple paths.

   *  Minimum latency (LAT): Optimizing latency for low latency.  This
      can be achieved by regularly checking multiple paths and using the
      one with the lowest latency or by parallel transmission over
      multiple path.

   *  Failure tolerance (FT): Optimizing for failure tolerance by
      parallel transfer on multiple paths.

   *  Evasion (EVA): Avoid certain links or ASes.

   The discussions of these categories are written with multiple paths
   per interface in mind (i.e. multiple paths per 4-tuple).  However,
   they can usually be generalized to multipathing over multiple
   interfaces.

   These categories can be combined, for example LAT and FT may often be
   combined and EVA can be can be useful in combination with any other
   category.

4.1.  Disjunctness

   For FT, paths are only interesting if they are disjunct.  For BW,
   paths should mostly be disjunct, but overlap is acceptable if the
   overlapping links have high BW available.

   For LAT, path disjunctness is mostly irrelevant.

   *TODO* Discuss link level, router level and AS level path
   disjunctness.

4.2.  Path Metadata

   SCION paths have associated metadata with latency and bandwidth
   information.  The values represent best case values and tend to be
   updated rarely, for example once a day.

   Path metadata may also be incomplete, ASes are not required to
   provide or regularly update the data.

   Users of path metadata must keep in mind that the data is mostly not
   verifiable but depends on the diligence and trustworthiness of the
   link owners.  However, once disseminated by a link owner, the path
   metadata is authenticated an cannot be changed by other parties.

   Due to the inherent unreliability, users should implement sanity
   checks as to whether a link holds up to the promised capabilities.

5.  Algorithms

5.1.  Path Selection

5.1.1.  Hybrid approach

   A hybrid approach could start with using low latency paths.  If the
   connection appears to be long lasting (e.g. at least 1 second
   duration and 1MB of traffic) it could start adding additional paths
   and see whether the traffic increases.  Additional paths can be
   chosen following the guidelines discussed in Section 6.1.

5.2.  MTU

   SCION provides MTU information for every AS-level link on a path.

5.3.  Detecting Byzantine ASes and Links

   By comparing performance (latency, bandwidth, packet drop rate, link
   errors, MTU) of multiple paths, we can (with some accuracy) detect
   unreliable links and ASes.  These can be blacklisted and excluded
   from further path selection, or possibly kept as backup paths for
   emergencies.

   *TODO* Add reference to research.

   *TODO* Move to Path Metadata section?

5.4.  DMTP

   One example of an application / algorithm is discussed in [DMTP].

5.5.  Congestion Control

   General recommendations for congestion control are defined in
   Congestion Control Principles [CC-PRINCIPLES].  Congestion control
   for QUIC is discussed in QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control
   [QUIC-RECOVERY].  More generally, congestion control for UDP is
   discussed in the UDP Usage Guidelines [UDP-GUIDELINES].  UDP MTU
   discovery is further developed in [MTU-DISCOVERY].

   Multipath congestion control is also discussed for TCP in
   [CC-MULTIPATH-TCP].  They state that "One of the prominent problems
   is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP
   independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than
   its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its
   subflows.".  This can be avoided in SCION through link-level analysis
   of flows and selecting paths that do not create or share a bottleneck
   link.  This avoids the need for Coupled Congestion Control.

   The second point in [CC-MULTIPATH-TCP] is "Further, it is desirable
   that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more
   traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property
   called "resource pooling" where a bundle of links effectively behaves
   like one shared link with bigger capacity.".  This can be achieved
   with a simple load distribution algorithm.

   *TODO* Differentiate "load distribution" from "path selection".

   There are several congestion control algorithms proposed in
   literature, e.g. LIA, OLIA, BALIA and RSF.  These combine congestion
   control with path selection algorithms.  For simplicity, we suggest
   separating concerns in terms of congestion control and path
   selection.  This allows us to better tailor the solutions to the
   different scenarios discussed in (SCENARIOS).  The proposition is to
   use standard congestion control per path (LIST HERE), tailored for
   each use case (max bandwidth / low latency) and on top of that
   separately use path selection (load distribution) algorithms.

   *TODO* Terminology: path selection vs load distribution?

5.6.  Load Distribution

   Load distribution algorithms are mainly useful for high bandwidth
   (HBW) scenarios.  They halp distribution the transfer load
   efficiently over multiple path.

   .. many things

   Last not least there is a relation to receiver buffer sizes.  The
   buffers are required to put packets back in order.  The available
   buffer size puts a hard limit on how different tha latency/jitter on
   the different paths are and how much large packet loss can be allowed
   before a buffer overrun will degrade performance.

6.  Applications

6.1.  Data Transfer

   The aim of a data transfer application is to maximize throughput,
   regardless of latency, jitter or packet loss.

   The solution here is to identify multiple paths that are either
   disjunct, or where the non-disjunct links allow higher throughput
   than other links on the same paths (i.e. high enough to prevent the
   link from being a bottleneck).

6.2.  Low Latency

   There are multiple approaches to transfer traffic with the lowest
   possible latency.  For example:

   1) With separate latency measurements.  Latency measurements run in
   parallel to data traffic.  This allows performing measurements at a
   different frequency and over many more paths than payload traffic.
   This can be useful if payload packets are large and sending them
   redundantly over multiple links is to costly or considered to
   invasive with respect to other network users.  Low frequency
   measurements may be combined with traffic prediction algorithms in
   order to identify best paths between measurements.  Due to low
   bandwidth overhead, this may be the most cost efficient approach.  It
   may be possible to do this with SCION SCMP packets, either with ECHO
   packets or possibly with traceroute if the AS internal latency of the
   destination AS is negligible (because it may be small or it may be
   almost the same for all border routers that are on interesting
   paths).

   2) With implicit measurements through QUIC ACK frames.  Section 13.2
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] recommends sending an ACK frame after receiving
   at least two ack-eliciting packets or after a delay.  If the
   application sends data on multiple paths in parallel, this may be
   sufficient for some low latency applications.  [QUIC-ACKFREQUENCY]
   proposes an extension that allows more control over how often and
   when ACK-FRAMES are sent.  This approach can be useful if
   [QUIC-ACKFREQUENCY] becomes available or if the ACK behavior of the
   standard QUIC server is sufficient.

   3) With implicit measurements through application specific ACKs.
   This is useful if the application can sensibly be adapted to have its
   own ACK protocol.

   Network analysis can be used to identify, and subsequently avoid,
   links with high or unreliable latency.

6.3.  High Availability / Redundancy

   An approach to high availability is to send data on multiple paths in
   parallel.  A tradeoff here is that sending on all available paths is
   probably infeasible.  Depending on cost factors, and to avoid
   overloading the network, any algorithms should keep redundant sending
   to a minimum.

   Path analysis can be used to identify multiple paths that are mostly
   or completely (using multiple interfaces) disjunct, but that still
   satisfy latency, bandwidth, and other constraints.

   Additional polling with SCMP or with additional QUIC stream may be
   used to regularly measure packet drop rates or latency variations.

6.4.  Multipathing for Anonymity

   Multipathing could also be used for anonymity, e.g. by switching
   paths at random intervals.  With a continuous data stream, care
   should be taken that new paths are not just switched over from one to
   the next, otherwise traffic characteristics may be used to identify
   paths.  For example, paths could be identified by packet frequency,
   packet burst frequency or general bandwidth.  For continuous stream,
   just moving one stream from one path to another may expose stream
   identity.

   As mitigation, a sender could start sending on a new path for a while
   before stopping sending on the old path.  The sender could send
   redundant data or random data at a suitable bandwidth.

   *TODO* Should we really recommend bandwidth usage.

   *TODO* Is this SCION specific?  SCION allows for choosing paths based
   on trusted or untrusted ASes, but this is not specific to
   multipathing...

7.  API Design consideration

7.1.  Multipathing for Applications

   Applications will have very different requirements on a multipath
   API.  A comprehensive API should therefore allow for mostly automatic
   selection of Section 5.1 Path Selection and Congestion Control
   algorithms Section 5.5.

   At the same time it should give access to SCION paths and their
   metadata to allow implementation of custom algorithms.

7.2.  Algorithm Integration

   Several proposals in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 suggest sending data
   redundantly in parallel on multiple paths.  Similarly, some proposals
   suggest sending packets purely for latency measurements.

   Congestion control algorithms and path selection algorithms should
   try to hide parallel transfer and measurement streams from the
   application.  This may also depend on API designer to provide such
   transparent multipathing with additional code on the application
   level.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

   May sending data on multiple paths in parallel, or at regular
   intervals, expose information about data streams?  E.g. can streams
   be associated with users such that a change in connection ID does not
   help anonymity?

8.1.  Latency Polling

   If a user sends latency measurements on 10 paths in parallel every 5
   seconds, then these 10 paths can (with some probability) be
   attributed to the same user.  Solution: do not send all probes at the
   same time.  To prevent patterns (1. after 0.1s, 2. after 0.3s, 3.
   after 0.35s, ...) the interval between packets on each path should
   also vary.  Additionally, the number of polled paths should vary.

8.2.  More ?

   See Section 6.4.

   *TODO*

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
