                Guidelines for QUIC Multipath over SCION
               draft-zaeschke-scion-quic-multipath-latest

Abstract

   This document provides guidelines for using the Multipath Extension
   for QUIC [QUIC-MP] with SCION [SCION-OVERVIEW].  SCION provides many
   details about available paths and allows selecting paths on the level
   of individual router interfaces.  This provide many opportunities for
   improving congestion control and other algorithms.  They also avoid
   some problems that gave rise to current algorithms.

   The guidlines in this document concern algorithms for congestion
   control, lload distribution and path selection, as well as general
   considerations for API design and applications that use multipath
   QUIC over SCION.

   This document discusses multipathing mainly in the sense of multiple
   paths per 4-tuple.  Multipathing over multiple interfaces is
   mentioned but not discussed in detail.

1.  Introduction

   The SCION protocol makes detailed path information available to
   endpoints.  Besides the 4-tuple of address/IP at each endpoint, the
   information includes a list of all traversed ASes and respective
   links between ASes, as well as metadata about ASes and links, such as
   MTU, bandwidth, latency, AS internal hopcount, or geolocation
   information.

   In the context of multipathing, this path information can be useful
   for algorithms that select paths (see Section 4.5) perform congestion
   control (see Section 4.3) and distribute load over all selected path
   Section 4.4.

   In order to facilitate these algorithms, this documents contains
   suggestions for API design and general use in applications.

   Multipath usage profiles are categorized into data transfer
   Section 5.1, low latency Section 5.2 and high availability /
   redundancy Section 5.3.

   One example of an application / algorithm is discussed in [DMTP].

1.1.  Terminology

   *Autonomous System (AS)*: An autonomous system is a network under a
   common administrative control.  For example, the network of an
   Internet service provider or organization can constitute an AS.

   *Core AS*: Each SCION isolation domain (ISD) is administered by a set
   of distinguished autonomous systems (ASes) called core ASes, which
   are responsible for initiating the path discovery and path
   construction process (in SCION called "beaconing").

   *Data Plane*: The data plane (sometimes also referred to as the
   forwarding plane) is responsible for forwarding data packets that
   endpoints have injected into the network.  After routing information
   has been disseminated by the control plane, packets are forwarded by
   the data plane in accordance with such information.

   *Egress/Ingress*: refers to the direction of travel.  In SCION, path
   construction with beaconing happens in one direction, while actual
   traffic might follow the opposite direction.  This document clarifies
   on a case-by-case basis whether 'egress' or 'ingress' refers to the
   direction of travel of the SCION packet or to the direction of
   beaconing.

   *Endpoint*: An endpoint is the start or the end of a SCION path, as
   defined in [PATH-VOCABULARY].

   *Hop Field (HF)*: As they traverse the network, path segment
   construction beacons (PCBs) accumulate cryptographically protected
   AS-level path information in the form of Hop Fields.  In the data
   plane, Hop Fields are used for packet forwarding: they contain the
   incoming and outgoing interface IDs of the ASes on the forwarding
   path.

   *Info Field (INF)*: Each path segment construction beacon (PCB)
   contains a single Info field, which provides basic information about
   the PCB.  Together with Hop Fields (HFs), these are used to create
   forwarding paths.

   *Interface Identifier (Interface ID)*: A 16-bit identifier that
   designates a SCION interface at the end of a link connecting two
   SCION ASes, with each interface belonging to one border router.  Hop
   fields describe the traversal of an AS by a pair of interface IDs
   called ConsIngress and ConsEgress, as they refer to the ingress and
   egress interfaces in the direction of path construction (beaconing).
   The Interface ID MUST be unique within each AS.  Interface ID 0 is
   not a valid identifier as implementations MAY use it as the
   "unspecified" value.

   *Isolation Domain (ISD)*: In SCION, Autonomous Systems (ASes) are
   organized into logical groups called Isolation Domains or ISDs.  Each
   ISD consists of ASes that span an area with a uniform trust
   environment (e.g. a common jurisdiction).  A possible model is for
   ISDs to be formed along national boundaries or federations of
   nations.

   *Leaf AS*: An AS at the "edge" of an ISD, with no other downstream
   ASes.

   *Inter AS link*: A direct link between two external interfaces of two
   ASes.

   *Intra AS link*: A direct link between twi internal interfaces of a
   single AS.  A direct link may contains several internal hops.

   *Link*: General term that refers to "inter-AS links" and "intra-AS
   links".

   *MAC*: Message Authentication Code.  In the rest of this document,
   "MAC" always refers to "Message Authentication Code" and never to
   "Medium Access Control".  When "Medium Access Control address" is
   implied, the phrase "Link Layer Address" is used.

   *Path Authorization*: A requirement for the data plane is that
   endpoints can only use paths that were constructed and authorized by
   ASes in the control plane.  This property is called path
   authorization.  The goal of path authorization is to prevent
   endpoints from crafting Hop Fields (HFs) themselves, modifying HFs in
   authorized path segments, or combining HFs of different path
   segments.

   *Path*: Besides the 4-tuple of address/IP at each endpoint, the
   information includes a list of all traversed ASes and respective
   links between ASes, as well as metadata about ASes and links, such as
   MTU, bandwidth, latency, AS internal hopcount, or geolocation
   information.

   *Path metadata*: Path metadata is additional data that is available
   to clients when they request a selection of paths to a destination.
   Path metadata is authenticated wrt to owner of each link, but
   otherwise not verified.

   *SCMP*: A signaling protocol analogous to the Internet Control
   Message Protocol (ICMP).  This is described in [SCION-CP].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Multipath Scenarios

   This document distinguishes the following usage scenarios:

   *  High bandwidth (HBW): Optimizing bandwidth by parallel transfer on
      multiple paths.

   *  Minimum latency (MinLat): Optimizing latency by regularly checking
      multiple paths and using the one with the lowest latency.

   *  Minimum latency through redundancy (MinLatRed): Optimizing latency
      by parallel transmission on multiple path.

   *  Failure tolerance (FT): Optimizing for failure tolerance by
      parallel transfer on multiple paths.

   The discussions of these scenarios are written with multiple paths
   per interface in mind (i.e. multiple paths per 4-tuple).  However,
   they can usually be generalized to multipathing over multiple
   interfaces.

   *TODO* "Usually" should be replaced with "Unless noted otherwise" or
   possibly "cannot be generalized, unless noted otherwise".  Let's see.

3.1.  Disjunctness

   For FT, paths are only interesting if they are disjunct.  For HWB,
   paths should mostly be disjunct, but overlap is acceptable if the
   overlapping links have high BW available.

   For MinLat and MinLatRed, path disjunctness is mostly irrelevant.

   *TODO* Discuss link level, router level and AS level path
   disjunctness.

3.2.  Path Metadata

   SCION paths have associated metadata with latency and bandwidth
   information.  The values represent best case values and tend to be
   updated rarely, for example once a day.

   Path metadata may also be incomplete, ASes are not required to
   provide or regularly update the data.

   Users of path metadata must keep in mind that the data is mostly not
   verifiable but depends on the diligence and trustworthiness of the
   link owners.  However, once disseminated by a link owner, the path
   metadata is authenticated an cannot be changed by other parties.

   Due to the inherent unreliability, users should implement sanity
   checks the verify that a link holds up to the promised capabilities.

4.  Algorithms

4.1.  MTU

   SCION provides MTU information for every AS-level link on a path.

4.2.  Detecting Byzantine ASes and Links

   By comparing performance (latency, bandwidth, packet drop rate, link
   errors, MTU) of multiple paths, we can (with some accuracy) detect
   unreliable links and ASes.  These can be blacklisted and excluded
   from further path selection, or possibly kept as backup paths for
   emergencies.

   *TODO* Add reference to research.

   *TODO* Move to Path Metadata section?

4.3.  Congestion Control

   General recommendations for congestion control are defined in
   Congestion Control Principles [CC-PRINCIPLES].  Congestion control
   for QUIC is discussed in QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control
   [QUIC-RECOVERY].  More generally, congestion control for UDP is
   discussed in the UDP Usage Guidelines [UDP-GUIDELINES].  UDP MTU
   discovery is further developed in [MTU-DISCOVERY].

   Multipath congestion control is also discussed for TCP in
   [CC-MULTIPATH-TCP].  They state that "One of the prominent problems
   is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP
   independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than
   its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its
   subflows.".  This can be avoided in SCION through link-level analysis
   of flows and selecting paths that do not create or share a bottleneck
   link.  This avoids the need for Coupled Congestion Control.

   The second point in [CC-MULTIPATH-TCP] is "Further, it is desirable
   that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more
   traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property
   called "resource pooling" where a bundle of links effectively behaves
   like one shared link with bigger capacity.".  This can be achieved
   with a simple load distribution algorithm.

   *TODO* Differentiate "load distribution" from "path selection".

   There are several congestion control algorithms proposed in
   literature, e.g. LIA, OLIA, BALIA and RSF.  These combine congestion
   control with path selection algorithms.  For simplicity, we suggest
   separating concerns in terms of congestion control and path
   selection.  This allows us to better tailor the solutions to the
   different scenarios discussed in (SCENARIOS).  The proposition is to
   use standard congestion control per path (LIST HERE), tailored for
   each use case (max bandwidth / low latency) and on top of that
   separately use path selection (load distribution) algorithms.

   *TODO* Terminology: path selection vs load distribution?

4.4.  Load Distribution

   Load distribution algorithms are mainly useful for high bandwidth
   (HBW) scenarios.  They halp distribution the transfer load
   efficiently over multiple path.

   .. many things

   Last not least there is a relation to receiver buffer sizes.  The
   buffers are required to put packets back in order.  The available
   buffer size puts a hard limit on how different tha latency/jitter on
   the different paths are and how much large packet loss can be allowed
   before a buffer overrun will degrade performance.

4.5.  Path Selection

4.5.1.  Hybrid approach

   A hybrid approach could start with using low latency paths.  If the
   connection appears to be long lasting (e.g. at least 1 second
   duration and 1MB of traffic) it could start adding additional paths
   and see whether the traffic increases.  Additional paths can be
   chosen following the guidelines discussed in Section 5.1.

5.  Applications (#apps}

5.1.  Data Transfer

   The aim of a data transfer application is to maximize throughput,
   regardless of latency, jitter or packet loss.

   The solution here is to identify multiple paths that are either
   disjunct, or where the non-disjunct links allow higher throughput
   than other links on the same paths (i.e. high enough to prevent the
   link from being a bottleneck).

5.2.  Low Latency

   There are multiple approaches to transfer traffic with the lowest
   possible latency.  For example:

   1) With separate latency measurements.  Latency measurements run in
   parallel to data traffic.  This allows performing measurements at a
   different frequency and over many more paths than payload traffic.
   This can be useful if payload packets are large and sending them
   redundantly over multiple links is to costly or considered to
   invasive with respect to other network users.  Low frequency
   measurements may be combined with traffic prediction algorithms in
   order to identify best paths between measurements.  Due to low
   bandwidth overhead, this may be the most cost efficient approach.  It
   may be possible to do this with SCION SCMP packets, either with ECHO
   packets or possibly with traceroute if the AS internal latency of the
   destination AS is negligible (because it may be small or it may be
   almost the same for all border routers that are on interesting
   paths).

   2) With implicit measurements through QUIC ACK frames.  Section 13.2
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] recommends sending an ACK frame after receiving
   at least two ack-eliciting packets or after a delay.  If the
   application sends data on multiple paths in parallel, this may be
   sufficient for some low latency applications.  [QUIC-ACKFREQUENCY]
   proposes an extension that allows more control over how often and
   when ACK-FRAMES are sent.  This approach can be useful if
   [QUIC-ACKFREQUENCY] becomes available or if the ACK behavior of the
   standard QUIC server is sufficient.

   3) With implicit measurements through application specific ACKs.
   This is useful if the application can sensibly be adapted to have its
   own ACK protocol.

   Network analysis can be used to identify, and subsequently avoid,
   links with high or unreliable latency.

5.3.  High Availability / Redundancy

   An approach to high availability is to send data on multiple paths in
   parallel.  A tradeoff here is that sending on all available paths is
   probably infeasible.  Depending on cost factors, and to avoid
   overloading the network, any algorithms should keep redundant sending
   to a minimum.

   Path analysis can be used to identify multiple paths that are mostly
   or completely (using multiple interfaces) disjunct, but that still
   satisfy latency, bandwidth, and other constraints.

   Additional polling with SCMP or with additional QUIC stream may be
   used to regularly measure packet drop rates or latency variations.

5.4.  Multipathing for Anonymity

   Multipathing could also be used for anonymity, e.g. by switching
   paths at random intervals.  With a continuous data stream, care
   should be taken that new paths are not just switched over from one to
   the next, otherwise traffic characteristics may be used to identify
   paths.  For example, paths could be identified by packet frequency,
   packet burst frequency or general bandwidth.  For continuous stream,
   just moving one stream from one path to another may expose stream
   identity.

   As mitigation, a sender could start sending on a new path for a while
   before stopping sending on the old path.  The sender could send
   redundant data or random data at a suitable bandwidth.

   *TODO* Should we really recommend bandwidth usage.

   *TODO* Is this SCION specific?  SCION allows for choosing paths based
   on trusted or untrusted ASes, but this is not specific to
   multipathing...

6.  API Design consideration

6.1.  Multipathing for Applications

   Applications will have very different requirements on a multipath
   API.  A comprehensive API should therefore allow for mostly automatic
   selection of Section 4.5 Path Selection and Congestion Control
   algorithms Section 4.3.

   At the same time it should give access to SCION paths and their
   metadata to allow implementation of custom algorithms.

6.2.  Algorithm Integration

   Several proposals in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 suggest sending data
   redundantly in parallel on multiple paths.  Similarly, some proposals
   suggest sending packets purely for latency measurements.

   Congestion control algorithms and path selection algorithms should
   try to hide parallel transfer and measurement streams from the
   application.  This may also depend on API designer to provide such
   transparent multipathing with additional code on the application
   level.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

   May sending data on multiple paths in parallel, or at regular
   intervals, expose information about data streams?  E.g. can streams
   be associated with users such that a change in connection ID does not
   help anonymity?

7.1.  Latency Polling

   If a user sends latency measurements on 10 paths in parallel every 5
   seconds, then these 10 paths can (with some probability) be
   attributed to the same user.  Solution: do not send all probes at the
   same time.  To prevent patterns (1. after 0.1s, 2. after 0.3s, 3.
   after 0.35s, ...) the interval between packets on each path should
   also vary.  Additionally, the number of polled paths should vary.

7.2.  More ?

   See Section 5.4.

   *TODO*

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
