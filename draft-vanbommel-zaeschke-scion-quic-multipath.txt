                       QUIC Multipath over SCION
             draft-vanbommel-zaeschke-scion-quic-mp-latest

Abstract

   Using Multipath Extension for QUIC [xxx] with SCION provides unique
   opportunities application but also for for congestion control, path
   selection and related algorithms.  This document discusses some
   opportunities and general recommendations.

1.  Introduction

   We consider several application profiles, including data transfer
   Section 4.1, low latency Section 4.2 and high availability /
   redundancy Section 4.3.

   One example of an application / algorithm is discussed in [DMTP].

   The aim of this document is to provide guidelins for designing and
   implementing multipathing over SCION.  Some key differences to
   traditional (non-SCION) networks are the availability of the actual
   route (on the granularity of autonomous systems) and the availability
   of path metadata, such as latency and banwidth, for path segments.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Algorithms

3.1.  Congestion Control

3.2.  Path Selection

3.2.1.  Hybrid approach

   A hybrid approach could start with using low latency paths.  If the
   connection appears to be long lasting (e.g. at least 1 second
   duration and 1MB of traffic) it could start adding additional paths
   and see whether the traffic increases.  Additional paths can be
   chosen following the guidlines discussed in Section 4.1

4.  Applications (#apps}

4.1.  Data Transfer

4.2.  Low Latency

4.3.  High Availability / Redundancy

5.  API Design consideration

   Applications will have very different requirments on a multipath API.
   A comprehensive API should therefore allow for mostly automatic
   selection of Section 3.2 Path Selection and Congestion Control
   algorithms Section 3.1.

   At the same time it should give access to SCION paths and their
   metadata to allow implementation of custom algorithms.

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
