         Guidelines for QUIC Multipath over Path Aware Networks
               draft-zaeschke-scion-quic-multipath-latest

Abstract

   This document provides guidelines for using the Multipath Extension
   for QUIC [QUIC-MP] with path aware networks (PAN).  PANs may provide
   hundreds of paths between endpoint, each path including detailed path
   metadata that facilitates informed path selection.

   Using the QUIC Multipath Extension over PAN creates pitfalls as well
   as opportunities for associated algorithms, such as for path
   selection, congestion control, and scheduling.  This document also
   gives general considerations for API design and applications that use
   multipath QUIC over SCION.

   This memo looks speciafically at PANs for inter domain routing.

1.  Introduction

   Path aware networks (PAN) may provide a large selection of available
   path, each path with detailed path metadata.  Path metadata may
   contain path properties such as latency, bandwidth, MTU, or
   geographic location, potentially with granularity down to individual
   links and router interfaces.

   When only one path is used, metadata and path selection capabilities
   allow identifying the best path for each use case while providing a
   suitable backup paths if the first paths degrades or others paths
   become comparatively better.

   When data is transferred over multiple paths in parallel, detailed
   metadata provides information about any links where different paths
   overlap and about the properties of these links.  This allows, for
   example, avoiding bottlenecks by choosing paths such that they don't
   share links that have low bandwidth capacity.  This is useful for
   developing or improving algorithms, for example for path selection,
   or more informed algorithms for congestion control.

   The recommendations in this document are categorized into
   recommendations for API design (Section 6), library implementations
   (Section 7) and algorithm design (Section 8).

   As a practical example of an inter-domain PAN with multipathing
   capability, we refer to the SCION [SCION-CP], [SCION-DP].

1.1.  SCION

   One example of a PAN is SCION [SCION-CP], [SCION-DP].  SCION is an
   inter-domain routing protocol that provides path metadata on the
   level of individual router interfaces.  This path metadata provides
   many opportunities for improving congestion control and other
   algorithms.  It also avoids some problems that gave rise to current
   algorithms.

   The SCION protocol makes detailed path information available to
   endpoints.  Besides the 4-tuple of address/IP at each endpoint, the
   information includes a list of all traversed ASes and respective
   links between ASes, as well as metadata about ASes and links,
   including MTU, bandwidth, latency, AS internal hopcount, or
   geolocation information.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   We assume that the reader is familiar with the terminology used in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] and [QUIC-MP].  We also draws on the terminology of
   SCION ([SCION-CP], [SCION-DP]).  For ease of reference, we have
   included some definitions here, but refer the reader to the
   references above for complete specifications of the relevant
   terminiology:

   *Autonomous System (AS)*: An autonomous system is a network under a
   common administrative control.  For example, the network of an
   Internet service provider or organization can constitute an AS.

   *Endpoint*: An endpoint is the start or the end of a path, as defined
   in [PATH-VOCABULARY].

   *Inter-AS Link*: A direct link between two external interfaces of two
   ASes.

   *Intra-AS Link*: A direct link between twi internal interfaces of a
   single AS.  A direct link may contains several internal hops.

   *Link*: General term that refers to "inter-AS links" and "intra-AS
   links".

   *Network Path*: Consists of a 4-tuple of address/IP at each endpoint,
   a list of all traversed ASes, and links inside and between ASes,
   including interface IDs on border routers of each AS.

   *Path ID*: The Path ID is defined in [QUIC-MP] . On the network
   layer, it is defined by a 4-tuple of IP/port of the local and remote
   endpoints.

   *Path Metadata*: Path metadata is additional data that is available
   to clients when they request a selection of paths to a destination.
   Path metadata is authenticated wrt to owner of each link, but
   otherwise not verified.  Path metadata includes data about ASes and
   links, such as MTU, bandwidth, latency, AS internal hopcount, or
   geolocation information.  Path metadata is updated infrequently,
   probably at most once per hour.  Properties such as bandwidth and
   latency represent hardware properties rather than live traffic
   information.

3.  Multipath Features

   This document discusses multipath features that are available in
   SCION [SCION-CP], [SCION-DP].  However, the discussion is kept
   general and relevant to all PAN that support these features.

3.1.  Path Metadata

   We assume that path metadata is reflects hardware properties rather
   than live traffic information (especially for bandwidth and latency).
   One should not expect path metadata is updated to be more than once
   every hour.  Path metadata is disseminated together with paths, so
   its freshness depends on the path livetime, wgich can be several
   hours.

3.1.1.  Path Metadata Granularity

   We assume a protocol for inter-AS routing that provides path
   information per AS, more specifically per border router of an AS and
   per any link between any border routers (link may be internal or
   external to an AS).

   That means, if we compare multiple paths, we can see where they
   overlap and what the hardware characteristics of the overlapping
   parts are.

3.1.2.  Path Metadata Dimensions

   We assume a protocol a provides information on links and border
   routers, such as MTU, bandwidth, latency, geo-location, as well as
   identities (interface ID, port and IP) of border routers.  We assume
   the data is static, which means that bandwidth and latency reflect
   hardware characteristics rather than current or recent load.

3.1.3.  Path Metadata Liveliness

   We assume that path metadata is updated at most every few hours.
   This should be more than sufficient since all values reflect hardware
   properties rather than current traffic load.

3.1.4.  Path Metadata Reliability

   We assume that all values are correct.  The metadata is
   cryptographically protected.  It is signed by the data originator,
   which is the relevant AS owner.  However, the data correctness is not
   verified, instead we rely on the AS owner to be honest.

3.2.  Path Selection

   We assume that a PAN protocol allows selecting paths explicitly,
   based, for example, on path metadata.  Paths can be added and removed
   from a connection.  Paths may have a best-before data and may expire,
   after which they are invalid.

4.  Multipath Categorization

   This document distinguishes the following usage categories:

   *  High bandwidth (BW): Optimizing bandwidth by parallel transfer on
      multiple paths.

   *  Minimum latency (LAT): Optimizing latency for low latency.  This
      can be achieved by regularly checking multiple paths and using the
      one with the lowest latency or by parallel transmission over
      multiple path.

   *  Failure tolerance (FT): Optimizing for failure tolerance by
      parallel transfer on multiple paths.

   *  Evasion (EVA): Avoid certain links or ASes, for example based on
      MTU, geolocation or AS number.

   The discussions of these categories are written with multiple paths
   per interface in mind (i.e. multiple paths per 4-tuple).  However,
   they can usually be generalized to multipathing over multiple
   interfaces.

   These categories can be combined, for example LAT and FT may often be
   combined and EVA can be can be useful in combination with any other
   category.

5.  Potential Problems -- WIP

5.1.  4-tuple changes

   If the 4-tuple changes, [QUIC-MP] and [QUIC-TRANSPORT] require
   several actions, including resetting congestion control and RTT
   estimation algorithms, and initiating path validation.

   Using path aware networks affects this in two ways:

   1.  PANs can provide detailed path information that can be used to
       detected path changes with high granularity.  This can affect
       algorithm design because they need to be less resilient against
       undetected path changes (diffserv, BGP route changes, ...) and
       can rely more on the path being consistent, at least to the
       granualrity offered by the PAN layer.

   2.  PANs, such as SCION, extend the network address with path, AS
       code and ISD code.  This means IP addresses do not need to be
       unique this would allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to change
       the destination of a connection without changing the destination
       port/IP.  This could be used to avoid path validation when
       coaxing a machine to send traffic to a new destination.  This
       attack is still not easy to execute because it requires the
       attacker to have control over an AS that lies en-route between
       server and client.

   *TODO* Illustration.

6.  API Considerations

6.1.  Initialization

   When a QUIC(-MP) socket is created, it can be useful (depending on
   the programming language) to allow injection of a custom UDP
   underlay.

   *  Custom DNS resolver (if the library resolves URLs)

   *  Custom Congestion control and RTT estimation algorithms

   *  Custom Packet scheduling algorithm

   *  PAN exclusive: path selection algorithms

6.2.  Network Address and Path

   Generally, it can be useful if any API of a QUIC-MP library uses not
   only IP/port for addressing local/remote peers, but uses a network
   address (IP + port + other identifiers, such as AS number) and a
   network path.

   Note that network path is different from QUIC-MP path ID.  There is
   usually a 1:1 mapping from network pagth to path ID, but the network
   path may change while the path ID stays the same.  For example, a PAN
   library may have paths that can expire and it may have a
   configuration option that expiring paths should be renewed
   automatically.  However, this works only for paths that are otherwise
   (except for the expiration date) identical.

6.3.  General API...?

   The API of a QUIC-MP implementation that works with PAN should
   probably provide interfaces for

   The API of a QUIC-MP implementation that works with PAN should:

   *  Expose Path ID

   *  Expose API for custom congestion control algorithms

   *  Expose callback for QUIC-MP path abandon (REFERENCE!!!)

   *  Expose API for name resolution (only of library does that), not
      useful if API works with IP/port only.

   *  Expose API for usage profile.  Applications will have very
      different requirements on a multipath API, see Section 4.  A
      comprehensive API should therefore allow for mostly automatic
      selection of Path Selection and Congestion Control algorithms.

7.  QUIC implementation Considerations

   *TODO READ:* See also "Implementation Considerations" in Section 5 of
   [QUIC-MP].

7.1.  Path Change Detection - Path Validation

7.1.1.  Problem

   Following Section 5.1 of [QUIC-MP] and Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT],
   endpoints MUST drop a connection or perform path validation when the
   4-tuple changes:

      "Not all changes of peer address are intentional, or active,
      migrations.  The peer could experience NAT rebinding: a change of
      address due to a middlebox, usually a NAT, allocating a new
      outgoing port or even a new outgoing IP address for a flow.  An
      endpoint MUST perform path validation (Section 8.2 of
      [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) if it detects any change to a peer's address,
      unless it has previously validated that address."

   With SCION, endpoints may use private IPs that are not globally
   unique, such as 192.168.0.1.  Two paths with an identical 4-tuple may
   therefore connect to two different machines if the machines are in
   different ASes but use the same IP/port.

   *TODO remove the following, it is probably wrong.*

   In short, an attacker can impersonate a client by using an identical
   IP/port to connect a server.  The server would probably just reverse
   the path and answer to the client without triggering a path
   validation.

   *TODO* What is the implication of this?

7.1.2.  Implication

   Path change detection is important for: - triggering a reset of
   congestion control and RTT estimation algorithms, see Section 9.4 of
   [QUIC-MP] - triggering path validation, see Section 9 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  *TODO Better understand the impact of this*

7.1.3.  Mitigation

   *  Allow to detect path changes while 4-tuple stays the same

      -  Port mangling?

      -  Change PATH-ID (SCION would need to know about QUIC...!!)

      -  Is PATH ID encrypted?  Then attacker cannot know it (but use,
         it, see replay, which is not possible due to sequence
         numbers??) ... so what?

      -  SCION could just drop packets where 4-tuple is the same but
         remote AS has changed.

      -  SCION could trigger a "double" path validation by changing the
         port/IP to a made up value and back to the original value.
         This would trigger two path validations.  However, at least
         eventually, the QUIC layer will know the correct remote IP/
         port.

7.2.  Path Change Detection - Path Injection

7.2.1.  Problem

   *TODO check SCION IRTF draft for this attack:*

   An attacker can send a spoofed packet to a server.  The packet
   contains a new path (for example broken or with high latency).  The
   server accepts the packet and stores the path for being used for all
   futur communication with the client.  The next packet sent to the
   client will take the injected malicious path and will fail (or at
   least be redirected).  This happens even if th epacket is rejectd by
   the QUIC(-MP) layer because the SCION layer will never learn about
   the packet being rejected.

7.2.2.  Mitigation

   *  Authenticate packets on SCION level.... There could still be a
      replay:

      -  Client uses path P1 (P1 could be injected with wormhole
         attack).

      -  Attacker captures packet with P1 path

      -  Attacker breaks P1 and forces migration to P2

      -  Attacker can no replay the original packet to get server to
         keep responding on the broken P1 path.

   *  Don't allow paths to change (for 4-tuple??) and require proper
      path migration (how?) or even a reconnect

   *  SOLUTION: The SCION layer MUST NOT cache paths locally, instead
      paths must be accepted by the QUIC layer before being used.

   Examples: * Java over DatagramChannel: * Comparing ResponsePath
   objects MUST return false if the paths differ.  * The QUIC layer MUST
   use only those addresses for sending data that have previously been
   accepted.  If an attacker sends a packet, it should be identified as
   malicious, be rejected, and the path should not be used.  Why would
   an attacker packet be accepted?  Replay should be impossible (there
   are apcket sequence IDs?), and any other requests should be
   cryptographically protected.  Can this attack be successful with
   spoofed IPs??? * Java over DatagramSocket: Problematic, it caches the
   paths... * C + Rust: How exactly do we map PathID to paths?  How are
   paths updated?

7.3.  Padding

   From Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]: "Clients MUST ensure that UDP
   datagrams containing Initial packets have UDP payloads of at least
   1200 bytes, adding PADDING frames as necessary."

   PAN packets may be bigger than traditional packets because they may
   carry additional routing information.

   *TODO* Measure SCION path header!

8.  Algorithm Considerations

   What has changed: - Much better MPU - Knowledge about shared links/
   routers between paths - indication of latency+bandwidth limits. -
   (Potentially live traffic info: Avoid "pulsing" -> Simon Scherer?)

8.1.  General

   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] requires that there is no connection migration
   during the initial handshake, and that there are no other packets
   send (including probing packets) during the initial handshake, see
   Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], paragraphs 2 and 3.

   We need to ensure on some level that no path change or probing
   occurs.

   *TODO* Read [QUIC-MP] on 4-tuple change / path validation. ->
   Section 9 in RFC 9000

8.2.  Algorithms

   *  MPU detection algorithm can be removed/replaced with metadata
      query See Path MTU Discovery in Section 14.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
      and Section 5.8 of [QUIC-MP].

   *  Congestion control algorithms:

      -  Must reset on path change (how?).

      -  Should benefit from knowledge about path overlaps.

      -  Follow BCP 133, see Section 7.10 of [CC-ALGORITHMS].

   *  Roundtrip time estimator.

      -  Must reset on path change (how?).  See also from Section 5.1 of
         [QUIC-MP]: "If path validation process succeeds, the endpoints
         set the path's congestion controller and round-trip time
         estimator according to Section 9.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]."

      -  Should benefit from knowledge about minimum latency expected on
         a path.

   *  Path selections algorithms

   *  Latency polling

      -  How bad is latency polling?

      -  Traceroute can help to reduce polling (ideally, every links is
         traversed only by one poll packet).  Traceroute also allows to
         identify links with high variance or generally hogh latency.

9.  OLD PART BELOW - IGNORE

10.  OLD - Algorithms

10.1.  Path Selection

10.1.1.  Dynamic Approach

   A dynamic approach could start with using low latency paths.  If the
   connection appears to be long lasting (e.g. at least 1 second
   duration and 1MB of traffic) it could start adding additional paths
   and see whether the traffic increases.  Additional paths can be
   chosen following the guidelines discussed in Section 12.1.

10.1.2.  Bottleneck Detection

   If no live traffic information is available, bottleneck detection can
   help to identify linkks that should be avoided.  In PAN this can be
   done using approaches such as [UMCC].

   One alternative is to use two SCMP traceroute commands that measure
   latency between two consecutive AS border routers.  The measured
   latency can be compared to earlier measurements or to the latency
   given in the path metadata.  Discrepancies can be an indication for
   high traffic and queueing problem on the measured link.

   *TODO* Should we discourage this?  It creates unnecessary traffic...

10.2.  MTU

   SCION provides MTU information for every AS-level link on a path.

10.3.  Detecting Byzantine ASes and Links

   By comparing performance (latency, bandwidth, packet drop rate, link
   errors, MTU) of multiple paths, we can (with some accuracy) detect
   unreliable links and ASes.  These can be blacklisted and excluded
   from further path selection, or possibly kept as backup paths for
   emergencies.

   *TODO* Add reference to research.

   *TODO* Move to Path Metadata section?

10.4.  DMTP

   One example of an application / algorithm is discussed in [DMTP].

10.5.  Congestion Control

   General recommendations for congestion control are defined in
   Congestion Control Principles [CC-PRINCIPLES].  Congestion control
   for QUIC is discussed in QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control
   [QUIC-RECOVERY].  More generally, congestion control for UDP is
   discussed in the UDP Usage Guidelines [UDP-GUIDELINES].  UDP MTU
   discovery is further developed in [MTU-DISCOVERY].

   Multipath congestion control is also discussed for TCP in
   [CC-MULTIPATH-TCP].  They state that "One of the prominent problems
   is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP
   independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than
   its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its
   subflows.".  This can be avoided in SCION through link-level analysis
   of flows and selecting paths that do not create or share a bottleneck
   link.  This avoids the need for Coupled Congestion Control.

   The second point in [CC-MULTIPATH-TCP] is "Further, it is desirable
   that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more
   traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property
   called "resource pooling" where a bundle of links effectively behaves
   like one shared link with bigger capacity.".  This can be achieved
   with a simple load distribution algorithm.

   *TODO* Differentiate "load distribution" from "path selection".

   There are several congestion control algorithms proposed in
   literature, e.g. LIA, OLIA, BALIA and RSF.  These combine congestion
   control with path selection algorithms.  For simplicity, we suggest
   separating concerns in terms of congestion control and path
   selection.  This allows us to better tailor the solutions to the
   different scenarios discussed in (SCENARIOS).  The proposition is to
   use standard congestion control per path (LIST HERE), tailored for
   each use case (max bandwidth / low latency) and on top of that
   separately use path selection (load distribution) algorithms.

   *TODO* Terminology: path selection vs load distribution?

10.6.  Load Distribution (Scheduling)

   Load distribution algorithms are mainly useful for high bandwidth
   (HBW) scenarios.  Latency may still be relevant though, for example
   for high definition video streams.  Scheduling halps distributing the
   transfer load efficiently over multiple path.

   However, sending data stream over multiple paths in parallel will
   usually result in packets arriving out of order at the receiver.
   This should be avoided because:

   *  Packet reordering requires larger buffers on the receiver side
      which are used to put packets back in order.  Latency, jitter and
      drop rate on different paths directly affect the required buffer
      size.

   *  Head of line blocking (HOLB): the latency of the slowest packet
      determines the effective latency of the stream.  This may be
      ignored for data transfers where latency is irrelevant.

   These problems can be mitigated, but it is difficult to do so for
   both problems at the same time.  A simple way to mitigate these
   problem is to select multiple paths with similar latency.

   Another way to mitigate these problems is to schedule packets on
   different paths such that they are likely to arrive in (more or less)
   the correct order.  Care should be taken to avoid requiring an
   equally large buffer on the sender side.

   *TODO* Check which existing algorithms do that.

   *TODO* Can we facilitate QUIC streams for this?

   *TODO* ?

12.  OLD - Applications

12.1.  Data Transfer

   The aim of a data transfer application is to maximize throughput,
   regardless of latency, jitter or packet loss.

   The solution here is to identify multiple paths that are either
   disjunct, or where the non-disjunct links allow higher throughput
   than other links on the same paths (i.e. high enough to prevent the
   link from being a bottleneck).

12.2.  Low Latency

   There are multiple approaches to transfer traffic with the lowest
   possible latency.  For example:

   1) With separate latency measurements.  Latency measurements run in
   parallel to data traffic.  This allows performing measurements at a
   different frequency and over many more paths than payload traffic.
   This can be useful if payload packets are large and sending them
   redundantly over multiple links is to costly or considered to
   invasive with respect to other network users.  Low frequency
   measurements may be combined with traffic prediction algorithms in
   order to identify best paths between measurements.  Due to low
   bandwidth overhead, this may be the most cost efficient approach.  It
   may be possible to do this with SCION SCMP packets, either with ECHO
   packets or possibly with traceroute if the AS internal latency of the
   destination AS is negligible (because it may be small or it may be
   almost the same for all border routers that are on interesting
   paths).

   2) With implicit measurements through QUIC ACK frames.  Section 13.2
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] recommends sending an ACK frame after receiving
   at least two ack-eliciting packets or after a delay.  If the
   application sends data on multiple paths in parallel, this may be
   sufficient for some low latency applications.  [QUIC-ACKFREQUENCY]
   proposes an extension that allows more control over how often and
   when ACK-FRAMES are sent.  This approach can be useful if
   [QUIC-ACKFREQUENCY] becomes available or if the ACK behavior of the
   standard QUIC server is sufficient.

   3) With implicit measurements through application specific ACKs.
   This is useful if the application can sensibly be adapted to have its
   own ACK protocol.

   Network analysis can be used to identify, and subsequently avoid,
   links with high or unreliable latency.

12.3.  High Availability / Redundancy

   An approach to high availability is to send data on multiple paths in
   parallel.  A tradeoff here is that sending on all available paths is
   probably infeasible.  Depending on cost factors, and to avoid
   overloading the network, any algorithms should keep redundant sending
   to a minimum.

   Path analysis can be used to identify multiple paths that are mostly
   or completely (using multiple interfaces) disjunct, but that still
   satisfy latency, bandwidth, and other constraints.

   Additional polling with SCMP or with additional QUIC stream may be
   used to regularly measure packet drop rates or latency variations.

12.4.  Multipathing for Anonymity

   Multipathing could also be used for anonymity, e.g. by switching
   paths at random intervals.  With a continuous data stream, care
   should be taken that new paths are not just switched over from one to
   the next, otherwise traffic characteristics may be used to identify
   paths.  For example, paths could be identified by packet frequency,
   packet burst frequency or general bandwidth.  For continuous stream,
   just moving one stream from one path to another may expose stream
   identity.

   As mitigation, a sender could start sending on a new path for a while
   before stopping sending on the old path.  The sender could send
   redundant data or random data at a suitable bandwidth.

   *TODO* Should we really recommend bandwidth usage.

   *TODO* Is this SCION specific?  SCION allows for choosing paths based
   on trusted or untrusted ASes, but this is not specific to
   multipathing...

13.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

   May sending data on multiple paths in parallel, or at regular
   intervals, expose information about data streams?  E.g. can streams
   be associated with users such that a change in connection ID does not
   help anonymity?

13.1.  Latency Polling

   If a user sends latency measurements on 10 paths in parallel every 5
   seconds, then these 10 paths can (with some probability) be
   attributed to the same user.  Solution: do not send all probes at the
   same time.  To prevent patterns (1. after 0.1s, 2. after 0.3s, 3.
   after 0.35s, ...) the interval between packets on each path should
   also vary.  Additionally, the number of polled paths should vary.

13.2.  Path Validation

   See Section 7.1 and Section 7.2.

13.3.  Wormhole Attack

   An attacking AS can manipulate metadata of its links and routers to
   announce a very attractive route that would then be the first choice
   of many route selection algorithms.  This would negatively affect
   performance of endhosts, especially if the links are manipulated to
   drop all packets (break link) or drop many packets (high drop rate).
   See Section 7.2.4 of [SCION-CP].

   Mitigation: Due to the inherent unreliability, users should implement
   sanity checks as to whether a link holds up to the promised
   capabilities.

13.4.  More ?

   See Section 12.4.
